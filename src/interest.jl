    Vasicek(a,b,σ,initial::FinanceCore.Rate)

A one-factor interest rate model. Parameters:

- `a` characterizes the speed of mean reversion
- `b` is the long term mean level
- `σ` is the instantaneous volatility

See more on Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasicek_model


Can be reinterpreted as a yield curve from FinanceModels.jl with `YieldCurve(s::ScenarioGenerator)`

    CoxIngersollRoss(a,b,σ,initial::FinanceCore.Rate)

A one-factor interest rate model. Parameters:

- `a` characterizes the speed of mean reversion
- `b` is the long term mean level
- `σ` is the instantaneous volatility

Via Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox%E2%80%93Ingersoll%E2%80%93Ross_model

Discretization: partial-truncation Euler (Deelstra–Delbaen) — the diffusion term
uses `√(max(r, 0))` so that a path which crosses zero does not throw a
`DomainError`, while the drift continues to pull the untruncated state back
toward `b`.

    HullWhite(a,σ,curve)

A one-factor interest rate model that should be market consistent with the given `curve`. `curve` may be:

- a FinanceModels.jl yield model (requires `using FinanceModels`), in which case θ is derived from the curve's instantaneous forwards via automatic differentiation, or
- a `FinanceCore.Rate` or plain `Real`, interpreted as a flat (continuously compounded, for `Real`) curve with a closed-form θ.
